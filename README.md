Why I Created This

This repository is part of my journey to understand the craft of Software Testing.
Each summary and note is a step toward building stronger analytical thinking, precision, and testing discipline.
It’s an evolving collection, updated as I continue to learn and grow. 

>  “The best testers aren’t those who find the most bugs, but those who ask the right questions.”
